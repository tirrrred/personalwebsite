          Once upon a time, in a <a href="https://www.eikefjord.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small, idyllic village</a> at the west coast of Norway, I small boy enjoyed the unconcerned and easy life with family and friends. Although several activities took alot of his time, 
          nothing could compare with the interest for <span class="contrast-blue">football</span> (the real type of football, not the kind they play in the US). It took most of his time, and he found a great love for the sport. To be honest, he was mostly focusing on having a good time with friends and playing footbal, 
          and fortunately those two could be combined, as good friends also played football. When it came to school, it was a scoial arena to meet friends and also have a good time. The academic results was not of interest, and more of a necessity to be done. Ufortunatley for the boy, 
          reality was lurking around the corner, and inevitble decisions about his future were needed to be faced. Without any clear plan for his career, he stumpled upon a oppurtuiniy to live out a classic small boy dream, and at the same time get a relevant and interesting education;
