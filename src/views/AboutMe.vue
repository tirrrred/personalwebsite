        <b-container class="text-block">
          Once upon a time, in a <a href="https://www.eikefjord.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small, idyllic village</a> on the west coast of Norway, 
          a small boy enjoyed the unconcerned and easy life with family and friends. As for most boys, it was an active childhood where several different sports took place, 
          but nothing could compare with the interest in football. All the time used to play football ensured an active, healthy, social boy, 
          who loved the sense of working in a team and achieving results with the team. This was the life; no worries, only football, and happiness! Unfortunately for the boy, 
          the reality was lurking around the corner, and inevitable decisions about his future were needed to be faced. Without any clear plan for his career, 
          he stumbled upon an opportunity to live out a classic boy's dream, and at the same time, get a relevant and exciting education;
          <a href="https://www.forsvaret.no/utdanning/utdanninger/ingeniorfag-studieretning-telematikk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="contrast-blue">the military</span></a>.<br><br>

          Character and <span class="contrast-blue">ambitions</span><br><p>A new chapter</p>
        </b-container>
        <b-container class="text-block">
          What a transition! The boy needed to adjust from the hassle-free time at high school to the result-oriented Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy. Not only did the academy 
          follow regular bachelor's degree education and courses, but it also provided military leadership and skills training. The days and evenings were structured and packed 
          with subjects and content. One day could be pure academic with engineering subjects, while the next day where a full-blown military exercise with demanding leadership 
          and personal challenges. Although the transition was rough, the boy loved it! The demanding environment, the individual and leadership development courses, the long hours, 
          both at the school bench and in the woods, the camaraderie, the teamwork - it all fueled his personality with energy and new joy. In this process, his new character was built, 
          and with it, higher aspiration and ambitions. Oh, by the way, he still got time to play football in his spare time, although not as much as previously.

        <b-container class="text-block">
          After some great years at the Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy, combining engineering subjects, military leadership training, football, and good social friendships, 
          it was time to see the world. The boy started as a system engineer in the Norwegian Armed Forces Cyber Defence. He quickly found a passion for the objectives and the mission 
          of the military unit. Before his first year in service, the first deployment was ready: Erbil, Iraq. To visit a part of the world where conflict and chaos are part of every 
          day was a first intriguing but had later put life in perspective. The boy gained confidence and self-esteem for the tour, but more importantly, he learned to appreciate the 
          safe and relatively unconcerned life in Norway. The deployment to Iraq motivated for several other tours, and after three and a half years working in the Armed Forces, 
          he had put behind four more tours to Kabul, Afghanistan.  As rewarding as all of these tours were, it was time to move on to new challenges. After three years in the 
          Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy and more than 3,5 years in the Norwegian Armed Forces Cyber Defence, exploring different military operations internationally, it was time to 
          explore a new world: Civilian life.
