          But in first <span class="contrast-blue">short</span>:<br><br>
          I love technology and people and how those two combined can provide business value. My goal is to create strong teams and organizations by exploiting the 
          synergy between tech, people, and business.<br><br>
          I currently lead an IT infrastructure team of 15 people responsible for secure and stable operations of critical financial systems.<br><br>
          Operational experience from the <a href="https://www.forsvaret.no/en/organisation/norwegian-cyber-defence" target="_blank">Norwegian Armed Forces Cyber Defence</a>,
          contribution in both domestic and <a href="https://www.forsvaret.no/en/exercises-and-operations/international-operations" target="_blank">international operations</a>, 
          and experience at designing, implementing, and operating enterprise infrastructure have provided a solid technical foundation. Leadership roles in both the 
          Armed Forces and DNB have sparked my love for leadership and people.

        <b-container class="text-block">
          Once upon a time, in a <a href="https://www.eikefjord.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small, idyllic village</a> on the west coast of Norway, 
          a small boy enjoyed the unconcerned and easy life with family and friends. As for most boys, it was an active childhood where several different sports took place, 
          but nothing could compare with the interest in <span class="contrast-blue">football</span>. All the time used to play football ensured an active, healthy, social boy, 
          who loved the sense of working in a team and achieving results with the team. This was the life; no worries, only football, and happiness! Unfortunately for the boy, 
          the reality was lurking around the corner, and inevitable decisions about his future were needed to be faced. Without any clear plan for his career, 
          he stumbled upon an opportunity to live out a classic boy's dream, and at the same time, get a relevant and exciting education;
          <a href="https://www.forsvaret.no/utdanning/utdanninger/ingeniorfag-studieretning-telematikk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="contrast-blue">the military</span></a>.<br><br>

          Character and <span class="contrast-blue">ambitions</span><br><p>A new chapter</p>
        </b-container>
        <b-container class="text-block">
          What a transition! The boy needed to adjust from the hassle-free time at high school to the result-oriented Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy. Not only did the academy 
          follow regular bachelor's degree education and courses, but it also provided military leadership and skills training. The days and evenings were structured and packed 
          with subjects and content. One day could be pure academic with engineering subjects, while the next day where a full-blown military exercise with demanding leadership 
          and personal challenges. Although the transition was rough, the boy loved it! The demanding environment, the individual and leadership development courses, the long hours, 
          both at the school bench and in the woods, the camaraderie, the teamwork - it all fueled his personality with energy and new joy. In this process, his new character was built, 
          and with it, higher aspiration and ambitions. Oh, by the way, he still got time to play football in his spare time, although not as much as previously.
