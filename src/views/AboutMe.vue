          But in <span class="contrast-blue">short</span>:<br><br>
          I love technology and people and how those two combined can provide business value. My goal is to create strong teams and organizations by exploiting the

          I currently lead an agile, IT infrastructure team of 13 people responsible for secure and stable operations of critical financial systems.<br><br>

          and experience at designing, implementing, and operating enterprise infrastructure have provided a solid technical foundation. Leadership roles in both the

        <b-container class="text-block">
          Once upon a time, in a <a href="https://www.eikefjord.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small, idyllic village</a> on the west coast of Norway, 
          a small boy enjoyed the unconcerned and easy life with family and friends. As for most boys, it was an active childhood where several different sports took place, 
          but nothing could compare with the interest in football. All the time used to play football ensured an active, healthy, social boy, 
          who loved the sense of working in a team and achieving results with the team. This was the life; no worries, only football, and happiness! Unfortunately for the boy, 
          the reality was lurking around the corner, and inevitable decisions about his future were needed to be faced. Without any clear plan for his career, 
          he stumbled upon an opportunity to live out a classic boy's dream, and at the same time, get a relevant and exciting education;
          <a href="https://www.forsvaret.no/utdanning/utdanninger/ingeniorfag-studieretning-telematikk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="contrast-blue">the military</span></a>.<br><br>

        </b-container>
        <b-container class="text-block">
          What a transition! The boy needed to adjust from the hassle-free time at high school to the result-oriented Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy. Not only did the academy 
          follow regular bachelor's degree education and courses, but it also provided military leadership and skills training. The days and evenings were structured and packed 
          with subjects and content. One day could be pure academic with engineering subjects, while the next day where a full-blown military exercise with demanding leadership 
          and personal challenges. Although the transition was rough, the boy loved it! The demanding environment, the individual and leadership development courses, the long hours, 
          both at the school bench and in the woods, the camaraderie, the teamwork - it all fueled his personality with energy and new joy. In this process, his new character was built, 
          and with it, higher aspiration and ambitions. Oh, by the way, he still got time to play football in his spare time, although not as much as previously.

        <b-container class="text-block">
          After some great years at the Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy, combining engineering subjects, military leadership training, football, and good social friendships, 
          it was time to explore the world. The boy started as a system engineer in the Norwegian Armed Forces Cyber Defence. He quickly found a passion for the objectives 
          and the mission of the military unit. The first deployment was ready before his first year in service: Erbil, Iraq. Visiting a part of the world where conflict and 
          chaos are part of every day was intriguing but had later put life in perspective. The boy gained confidence and self-esteem from that tour, but more importantly, 
          he learned to appreciate the safe and relatively unconcerned life back in Norway. The deployment to Iraq motivated for several other tours, and after three and a 
          half years working in the Armed Forces, he had put behind four more tours to Kabul, Afghanistan, in addition to the Erbil, Iraq tour.  As rewarding as all of these 
          tours were, it was time to move on to new challenges. After three years in the Norwegian Defence Cyber Academy and more than 3,5 years in the Norwegian Armed Forces 
          Cyber Defence, exploring different military operations internationally, it was time to explore a new world: Civilian world.

          The new <span class="contrast-blue">world</span>

        <b-container class="text-block">
          Have you ever felt <span class="contrast-blue">overwhelmed</span>? Sure you have, and so did the boy!  It really felt like a new world. Getting up to speed on 
          the required domain knowledge was deterring, and by comparing himself with his senior colleagues, it seems like an impossible road to walk. Imposter syndrome, heard of it?
          However, it was not the domain knowledge alone that made it overwhelming. The added complexity of the organization, history of the enterprise with mergers, acquisitions, and reorganizations 
          made it challenging to navigate the corporate landscape. At least for a while. <br><br>

          Although not directly transferable skills, the experience attained from previous employment, operations, and tours abroad helped the boy fight the overwhelming feelings and 
          the imposter syndrome. The boy managed quite well by being analytic, hard-working, curious, humble, and honest. He communicated well and got the hang of both the domain knowledge 
          and the organization and political structure of the enterprise. And before he knew, he was team lead for 15 professional engineers and architects, 
          managing and operating nationwide critical infrastructure. He <span class="contrast-blue">loved</span> it! Working closely with the team members, service owner, and other units of the organization, all to improve and optimize 
          the value from the team, the technology, the processes, and the organization. And you bet he learned from it! Yet, everything that has a beginning must have an end. It was time for <span class="contrast-blue">new challenges</span> yet again.

           The boy started now as a consultant. By reflecting over his last years of experience, he realized that he loved learning about new people, organizations, 
           and technology, with a good knowledge of the overarching picture and insight into the details. <br><br>

           Now he wants to explore this potential with different businesses and organization. Let's see how it goes!
